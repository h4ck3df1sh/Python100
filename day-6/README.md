# Reeborg's World Challenge Solutions

This folder contains Python scripts that serve as solutions to various challenges from Reeborg's World (http://reeborg.ca/). The challenges are part of the educational programming environment where users interact with a virtual robot named "Reeborg" to learn programming concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## About Reeborg's World

Reeborg's World is a platform that provides a virtual world where users can write Python or JavaScript code to control the actions of the robot character, Reeborg. The environment allows users to tackle programming challenges that involve moving the robot, making decisions, and solving puzzles using loops, conditions, functions, and other programming concepts.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `challenge_1.py`: Python script for Challenge 1
- `challenge_2.py`: Python script for Challenge 2
- `challenge_3.py`: Python script for Challenge 3
- ...
- `challenge_n.py`: Python script for Challenge n

Each Python script corresponds to a specific challenge from Reeborg's World.

## Note about Functions

In the Python scripts, you will see various functions that are used to solve the challenges. It's important to mention that these functions are already defined in the Reeborg's World environment. Users don't need to define these functions in the scripts as they are provided by the platform.

## How to Use the Scripts

To use these scripts, you need to:

1. Access Reeborg's World at http://reeborg.ca/ and open the programming editor.
2. Select a challenge you want to solve.
3. Copy the contents of the corresponding Python script (`challenge_x.py`) into the programming editor.
4. Run the code to see Reeborg perform the actions and complete the challenge.

Feel free to explore the solutions in this repository and use them as a reference to learn how to tackle the challenges on your own.
