### Example of a Good Commit Message:

```
[Feature] Add new files: index.html and style.css

- Added index.html file with the basic structure of the web page.
- Included style.css file with initial styling for the website header.

These new files set up the foundation for the front-end of the website and are the starting point for further development.
