🎉 **Welcome to the Python100 Project!** 🐍

In this repository, you will find a collection of 100 projects created by me in Python, covering a wide range of topics, from command-line applications to graphical interfaces, and including machine learning projects and web scraping. I have created this repository with the aim of improving my Python skills and exploring different areas of programming.

📁 **Repository Contents**

Here you will find projects organized into the following categories:

- 🖥️ **Command-Line Applications:** Projects that run in the terminal and use text input and output to interact with the user.

- 🖼️ **Graphical Interfaces:** Projects that utilize graphical libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy to create user interfaces with buttons, windows, and other interactive components.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning:** Projects related to machine learning, such as classification, regression, clustering, and more.

- 🕸️ **Web Scraping:** Projects to extract data from web pages using libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

🚀 **Instructions to Run the Projects**

Each project is located in its own folder and contains a README file with specific instructions on how to run it. Be sure to fulfill any prerequisites before trying each project.
